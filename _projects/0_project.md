At UC Berkeley/HHMI in Prof. Carlos J. Bustamante's lab, I'm investigating one of the most fascinating aspects of viral life cycles: how virally encoded ATPase motors propel viral genomes into preassembled containers. This mechanism is utilized by many dsDNA bacteriophages and their eukaryotic counterparts, including herpes-, adeno-, and poxviruses.

## Research Focus

My research aims to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which these packaging machines harness ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release to generate mechanical force. This work bridges structural insights with functional dynamics to provide a comprehensive understanding of viral packaging motors.

## Methodological Approach

This research employs cutting-edge single-molecule manipulation techniques, including:

1. High-resolution optical tweezers to measure force generation
2. Fluorescence microscopy to track protein dynamics
3. Correlative approaches combining structural and functional data
4. Advanced data analysis to extract mechanistic insights

## Key Questions

Our research addresses several fundamental questions:

- How do viral packaging motors convert chemical energy into mechanical work?
- What is the coordination mechanism between multiple ATPase subunits?
- How do these motors maintain processivity while packaging large genomes?
- What are the rate-limiting steps in the packaging process?
- How do these motors overcome increasing internal pressure during packaging?

## Broader Implications

Understanding viral packaging mechanisms has significant implications for:

- Development of novel antiviral strategies targeting packaging motors
- Engineering of synthetic molecular machines for biotechnology applications
- Fundamental insights into energy transduction in biological systems
- Principles of macromolecular assembly in confined spaces

This research not only advances our understanding of viral biology but also provides insights into general principles of molecular motors and energy transduction in biological systems.
