This project focused on developing a novel thiol-specific PEGylation strategy using catechol-derived reactive quinone species. The goal was to create an efficient method for protein modification that could extend the half-life of therapeutic proteins while maintaining their biological activity.

## Technical Innovation

Our approach involved:
1. Synthesis of catechol-derived polyethylene glycol (PEG) by:
   - Coupling linear PEG N-hydroxysuccinimide to dopamine
   - Oxidizing the product to quinone form (PEG-dopaquinone or PEG-DAQ)

## Key Findings

The research demonstrated:
1. High thiol-specificity of PEG-DAQ
2. Successful modification of model proteins:
   - Truncated flagellin (CBLB502)
   - Recombined human ciliary neurotrophic factor (rhCNTF)
3. Selective targeting of free cysteine residues

## Impact

This research contributed to the field of protein modification by:
- Introducing a new thiol-specific PEGylation strategy
- Demonstrating successful modification of therapeutic proteins
- Providing a potential platform for developing long-acting protein therapeutics

The methodology developed in this project offers a valuable tool for protein modification, particularly in cases where selective cysteine modification is desired.
