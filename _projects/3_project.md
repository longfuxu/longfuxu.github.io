This research investigates the molecular mechanisms of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) and their crucial role in DNA replication. Using bacteriophage T7 DNAp and SSB, we explored how these proteins interact during DNA replication processes, revealing how replication machinery actively displaces protective proteins from single DNA strands in a coordinated manner.

## Key Findings

Our single-molecule force spectroscopy revealed several key aspects of T7 SSB behavior:

1. Modulates DNA replication in an ssDNA conformation-dependent manner
2. Is regulated by tension applied to the DNA template
3. Remains stationary as DNAp approaches
4. Shows sequential displacement rather than being pushed forward

## Impact and Significance

Our research revealed several groundbreaking aspects of DNA replication:

1. SSB molecules are actively displaced by DNA replication machinery
2. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered reduced energy barriers for SSB dissociation
3. Faster replication rates were observed compared to intrinsic SSB dissociation
4. Spatial-temporal coordination between SSB and DNAp is crucial for resolving molecular collisions

This work provides crucial insights into a universal strategy employed by DNA translocating motors to ensure genome integrity during replication.
