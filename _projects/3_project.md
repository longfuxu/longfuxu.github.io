This research investigates the molecular mechanisms of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) and their crucial role in DNA replication. Using bacteriophage T7 DNAp and SSB, we explored how these proteins interact during DNA replication processes. DNA replication machinery actively displaces protective proteins from single DNA strands one-by-one in a coordinated manner to ensure efficient genome duplication.

## Key Findings

Our single-molecule force spectroscopy demonstrated that T7 SSB:
- Modulates DNA replication in an ssDNA conformation-dependent manner
- Is regulated by tension applied to the DNA template
- Remains stationary as DNAp approaches
- Shows sequential displacement rather than being pushed forward

## Impact and Significance

The research revealed several important aspects:
- SSB molecules are actively displaced by DNA replication machinery
- Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered reduced energy barriers for SSB dissociation
- Faster replication rates were observed compared to intrinsic SSB dissociation
- Spatial-temporal coordination between SSB and DNAp is crucial for resolving molecular collisions during DNA replication

This work provides insights into a universal strategy employed by other DNA translocating motors to ensure genome integrity.
