This research focused on developing an improved version of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with enhanced therapeutic potential. CNTF shows promise for treating neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases but is limited by its rapid clearance from the body. We addressed this challenge by creating a novel fusion protein.

## Research Strategy

Our approach involved:
1. Genetic fusion of recombinant human CNTF (rhCNTF) with an albumin-binding domain (ABD)
2. Connection through a flexible peptide linker
3. Design aimed at binding with endogenous human serum albumin (HSA)
4. Utilizing HSA's naturally long half-life properties

## Key Innovation

The key innovation of this project was the strategic use of albumin binding to extend the protein's circulation time. By binding to HSA, the fusion protein could leverage albumin's natural long half-life properties, potentially improving its therapeutic efficacy.

## Impact

This research contributed to the field of protein therapeutics by:
- Developing a novel approach to extend protein half-life
- Creating a potentially more effective CNTF variant
- Demonstrating the viability of albumin binding for therapeutic proteins

The findings from this project have implications for the development of other therapeutic proteins where extended half-life is desired.
