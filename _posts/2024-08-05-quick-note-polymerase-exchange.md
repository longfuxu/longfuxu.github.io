Interesting observation from today's experiments: DNA polymerase exchange rates increase dramatically when we apply forces >20 pN during replication.

**Key points:**
- Exchange rate ~3x higher at 25 pN vs. 5 pN
- Replication speed decreases but fidelity appears unchanged
- Suggests force-dependent conformational changes

**Implications:**
- May explain in vivo behavior under DNA tension
- Could be relevant for replication fork restart mechanisms
- Worth investigating with molecular dynamics simulations

**Next steps:**
- Systematic force-dependence study (5-30 pN range)
- Check if this holds for different polymerases
- Correlate with structural data on force-induced conformational changes

*Quick notes like this help capture observations before they get lost in the daily research flow.*
