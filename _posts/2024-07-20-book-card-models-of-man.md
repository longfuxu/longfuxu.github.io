## Book Details
**Title:** Models of Man: Social and Rational  
**Author:** Herbert A. Simon  
**Year:** 1957  
**Key Concept:** Bounded Rationality

## Main Argument

Simon challenges the classical economic assumption of perfectly rational actors, proposing instead that humans operate under "bounded rationality"—we make decisions that are "good enough" rather than optimal, constrained by:
- Limited information
- Cognitive processing limitations  
- Time constraints

## Key Insights for Scientists

### 1. Satisficing vs. Optimizing
> "The capacity of the human mind for formulating and solving complex problems is very small compared with the size of the problems whose solution is required for objectively rational behavior."

**Application:** In research, we often need to choose "good enough" experimental designs rather than perfect ones, given time and resource constraints.

### 2. Search and Decision-Making
Simon describes decision-making as a search process that stops when an acceptable solution is found, not when the best possible solution is identified.

**Relevance:** This mirrors how we approach research problems—we explore until we find satisfactory answers, not exhaustive ones.

### 3. Organizational Behavior
Organizations shape individual decision-making by providing:
- Information channels
- Decision premises
- Attention-directing mechanisms

**Lab Application:** How we structure research groups affects the kinds of questions we ask and solutions we find.

## Connections to Current Work

This framework helps understand:
- **Experimental Design:** Why we use "rule of thumb" approaches rather than exhaustive optimization
- **Literature Review:** How we decide when we've read "enough" papers
- **Collaboration:** How information flow in research teams affects problem-solving

## Limitations

- Model assumes more systematic search than often occurs
- Doesn't fully account for emotional/intuitive decision-making
- Less applicable to highly technical/specialized domains

## Worth Reading If...

You're interested in:
- How scientists actually make decisions (vs. idealized models)
- Organizational design for research teams
- Philosophy of bounded vs. perfect rationality

**Rating:** ★★★★☆  
**Time Investment:** ~6 hours  
**Takeaway:** Embrace "good enough" decisions; perfect rationality is neither achievable nor always desirable.
