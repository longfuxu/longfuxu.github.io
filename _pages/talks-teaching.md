## Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching biophysics emphasizes:

1. **Hands-on Learning**: Students learn best by directly engaging with experimental techniques and data analysis
2. **Conceptual Understanding**: Focus on physical principles rather than memorization of facts
3. **Real-world Applications**: Connect theoretical concepts to current research problems
4. **Collaborative Learning**: Encourage peer-to-peer learning and group problem-solving

## Course Development

### "Single-Molecule Biophysics: From Theory to Practice"
*Currently developing for UC Berkeley (planned 2025)*

**Course Objectives:**
- Understand the physical principles underlying single-molecule techniques
- Gain hands-on experience with optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy
- Develop skills in single-molecule data analysis
- Apply techniques to address biological questions

**Innovative Elements:**
- Virtual lab simulations for remote learning
- Student-led journal club discussions
- Final projects involving real research data

## Educational Resources

### Open Access Materials

- **Single-Molecule Data Analysis Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for processing optical tweezers data
- **Force Spectroscopy Protocols**: Detailed experimental procedures with troubleshooting guides
- **Biophysics Problem Sets**: Collection of problems with worked solutions

### Online Presence
