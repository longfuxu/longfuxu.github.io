## Why These Interests Matter

These activities aren't just hobbies—they directly enhance my research by:

- **Science Writing** improves clarity in papers and grants
- **Data Visualization** makes complex results accessible and compelling  
- **Philosophy** provides frameworks for thinking about scientific problems
- **Computing** enables more efficient and reproducible research
- **Entrepreneurship** connects research to real-world applications
- **Photography** develops visual thinking and attention to detail

## Current Projects

### Writing
Working on a series of essays about the role of chance and contingency in scientific discovery, exploring how unexpected results often lead to the most important breakthroughs.

### Visualization
Developing interactive tools for exploring single-molecule data, making it easier for researchers to identify patterns and anomalies in complex datasets.

### Computing
Contributing to open-source analysis software for optical tweezers experiments, with a focus on making advanced analysis techniques accessible to more researchers.

## Reading List

Currently exploring books that bridge science, technology, and society:

- *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* by Thomas Kuhn
- *Seeing Like a State* by James C. Scott  
- *The Innovator's Dilemma* by Clayton Christensen
- *Antifragile* by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

## Connect & Collaborate

Interested in any of these areas? I'm always open to:
- Collaborative writing projects
- Open-source software development
- Discussions about science, technology, and society
- Photography expeditions (especially scientific subjects!)
