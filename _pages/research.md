## Why Study Viral DNA Replication and Packaging?

Viruses are among the most abundant biological entities on Earth, yet many fundamental aspects of their life cycles remain poorly understood. By studying viral DNA replication and packaging at the single-molecule level, we can uncover the fundamental mechanisms that govern these processes and potentially identify new therapeutic targets for treating viral infections and genetic diseases.

## What We Study

My research focuses on three interconnected themes that together provide a comprehensive view of viral DNA dynamics:

### DNA Replication Dynamics

Traditional models of DNA replication assumed a highly coordinated process with stable protein complexes. However, our single-molecule studies reveal a much more dynamic picture. Using correlative optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy, we've shown that DNA polymerases exchange rapidly during replication, leading to a "decentralized model" of this fundamental process.

**Key findings:**
- DNA polymerases exchange much more frequently than previously thought
- This dynamic exchange contributes to replication robustness and error correction
- Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins play crucial regulatory roles

**Representative publication:** [Nature Communications (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49612-3)

### DNA-Protein Interactions

Understanding how proteins interact with DNA is crucial for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of replication and packaging. We study these interactions using advanced single-molecule techniques that allow us to observe individual proteins in action.

**Focus areas:**
- Single-stranded DNA-binding protein dynamics
- Polymerase-SSB interactions during replication
- Force-dependent protein behavior

### Viral DNA Packaging

The packaging of viral genomes into preassembled capsids is one of the most fascinating processes in virology. We study how ATPase motors convert chemical energy into mechanical force to translocate DNA into viral capsids.

**Current investigations:**
- Mechanism of ATP-driven DNA translocation
- Role of motor protein coordination
- Force generation and energy efficiency

## How We Study It

Our approach combines cutting-edge biophysical techniques to observe biological processes in real-time at the single-molecule level:

### Optical Tweezers
- Measure forces (0.1-100 pN) and displacements (nm precision)
- Study DNA mechanics and protein-DNA interactions
- Apply controlled forces to investigate force-dependent processes

### Single-Molecule Fluorescence
- Visualize individual proteins and DNA molecules
- Track protein binding and dissociation events
- Correlate structural changes with functional dynamics

### Correlative Approaches
- Combine force and fluorescence measurements
- Simultaneous mechanical and optical readouts
- Comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanisms

## So What?

This research has broad implications for our understanding of fundamental biological processes:

**Basic Science:**
- Reveals the dynamic nature of DNA metabolism
- Challenges traditional models of genetic processes
- Provides mechanistic insights into virus-host interactions

**Translational Potential:**
- Identifies new targets for antiviral therapeutics
- Informs the development of gene therapy vectors
- Contributes to our understanding of genetic diseases

## Open Questions & Future Directions

- How do motor proteins coordinate during DNA packaging?
- What role does DNA topology play in replication dynamics?
- Can we engineer more efficient DNA packaging systems?
- How do viral replication strategies inform cellular DNA repair mechanisms?
