I am a biophysicist interested in decoding viral life cycles—especially viral DNA replication and DNA packaging—from a single-molecule perspective. My goal is to deepen our understanding of these fundamental processes, potentially opening new pathways for treating genetic diseases and preventing future viral threats.

Currently, I am a Damon Runyon Fellow and a postdoctoral researcher in [Professor Carlos J. Bustamante's laboratory](http://bustamante.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley/HHMI. My work focuses on how virally encoded ATPase motors translocate viral genomes into preassembled capsids—a critical step in the life cycle of many dsDNA bacteriophages and their eukaryotic counterparts (e.g., herpesviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses). A central goal is to understand how these molecular machines convert the chemical energy from ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release into mechanical force for genome packaging.

Previously, I completed my PhD and postdoctoral training in [Professor Gijs Wuite’s laboratory](www.gijswuite.com) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. There, I developed and applied correlative optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy techniques to study DNA replication dynamics in a simplified T7 bacteriophage system. Our findings revealed that DNA replication is significantly more dynamic than previously understood, leading to the proposal of a “decentralized model” for this process (see our recent [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49612-3) publication). Earlier in my career, I earned my MSc from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with Professors Zhiguo Su and Yongdong Liu. My research focused on developing novel long-acting biopharmaceuticals using PEGylation and albumin-binding domain technologies.
