I am a biophysicist in [Prof. Carlos J. Bustamante's lab](http://bustamante.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley/HHMI, interested in decoding viral life cycles—especially viral DNA replication and DNA packaging—from a single-molecule perspective. My current research focuses on understanding these fundamental processes and potentially opening new avenues for antiviral strategies.

Prior to joining UC Berkeley, I pursued my PhD and postdoctoral research in [Professor Gijs Wuite’s laboratory](www.gijswuite.com) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Employing advanced single-molecule techniques, we revisited fundamental DNA replication mechanisms using a simplified bacteriophage T7 system. One key finding revealed that replication is more dynamic than previously believed, prompting us to propose a “decentralized model,” as detailed in our recent [Nature Communications publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49612-3).

My Master of Science degree was obtained at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidence of Professors Zhiguo Su and Yongdong Liu. During this period, my research centered on novel approaches to long-acting biopharmaceuticals, including PEGylation and albumin-binding domain fusion, aimed at enhancing therapeutic efficacy.
