</div>

## Vision

Research laboratories worldwide house valuable materials—cell lines, plasmids, proteins, specialized reagents—that could accelerate scientific discovery if shared efficiently. **SciXchange** aims to create a trusted platform where researchers can exchange these materials, reducing duplication of effort and accelerating the pace of scientific progress.

*Note: This is a personal project in early development, not affiliated with any other organization using similar names.*

## Core Mechanism

### Identity Verification
- **Institutional Authentication**: Integration with university and research institution credentials
- **ORCID Integration**: Leverage existing academic identity systems
- **Verification Levels**: Tiered trust system based on institutional affiliation and research track record

### Compliance Framework
- **Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs)**: Automated generation and tracking
- **Export Control Compliance**: Built-in screening for regulated materials
- **IP Protection**: Clear guidelines for intellectual property handling
- **Biosafety Standards**: Integration with institutional biosafety protocols

### Credit-Based Exchange
- **Contribution Points**: Earn credits by sharing materials and providing quality
- **Exchange Currency**: Use credits to request materials from other labs
- **Reputation System**: Track successful exchanges and material quality
- **Incentive Alignment**: Reward active participation and high-quality contributions

## User Journey

### For Research Scientists
1. **Discovery**: Search for materials by type, organism, application
2. **Request**: Submit standardized requests with research justification
3. **Compliance Check**: Automated MTA and compliance verification
4. **Exchange**: Coordinate shipping and transfer logistics
5. **Feedback**: Rate material quality and exchange experience

### For Lab Managers
1. **Inventory**: Catalog available materials with detailed metadata
2. **Policy Setting**: Define sharing policies and restrictions
3. **Request Management**: Review and approve outgoing material requests
4. **Tracking**: Monitor material usage and citation tracking
5. **Analytics**: Understand lab sharing patterns and impact

## Current Status

**Development Phase**: Internal testing and validation  
**Target Launch**: Early 2026  
**Initial Focus**: Academic research institutions in life sciences

### Join the Waitlist

Interested in participating in the beta testing phase? We're looking for:
- Research labs with active material sharing needs
- Institutional tech transfer offices
- Graduate students and postdocs who frequently request materials

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from existing repositories?
While repositories like Addgene focus on specific material types, SciXchange aims to be a comprehensive platform for diverse research materials, with emphasis on compliance automation and credit-based incentives.

### What about intellectual property protection?
All exchanges will be governed by appropriate MTAs, with built-in IP protection mechanisms. The platform will provide template agreements and legal guidance.

### How will material quality be ensured?
Through a combination of community feedback, institutional reputation, and standardized quality metrics. Contributors will be incentivized to maintain high standards.

### What materials will be included?
Initially: plasmids, cell lines, antibodies, proteins, and small molecules. The platform will expand based on community needs and regulatory feasibility.

### How will shipping and logistics work?
SciXchange will partner with specialized scientific shipping providers and provide coordination tools, while actual shipping remains between the exchanging parties.

### What about biosafety and export controls?
The platform will integrate with institutional biosafety committees and include automated screening for export-controlled materials.

## Technical Implementation

The platform is being developed with:
- **Blockchain-based reputation system** for transparent credit tracking
- **API integrations** with existing lab management systems
- **Machine learning** for material recommendation and matching
- **Automated compliance checking** for regulatory requirements
