## Teaching Philosophy

As a scientist working at the intersection of physics and biology, I believe in fostering a deep understanding of fundamental principles while encouraging students to explore interdisciplinary connections. My teaching approach emphasizes hands-on experience, critical thinking, and the development of practical skills that prepare students for careers in research and beyond.

## Teaching Experience

### UC Berkeley
- **Laboratory Techniques in Biophysics** (2023-Present)
  - Instructed graduate students on advanced single-molecule techniques
  - Developed practical workshops on optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy

### Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
- **Advanced Biophysics** (2019-2022)
  - Taught graduate-level courses on single-molecule biophysics
  - Designed and supervised laboratory practicals

- **Introduction to Molecular Biology** (2018-2021)
  - Conducted tutorial sessions for undergraduate students
  - Created problem sets focusing on DNA replication and protein-DNA interactions

## Mentoring Activities

### Research Supervision
- Supervised 5 Master's students and 3 undergraduate research projects
- Mentored junior PhD students in experimental design and data analysis

### Workshop Organization
- Co-organized the "Single-Molecule Techniques Workshop" at VU Amsterdam (2021)
- Led hands-on training sessions on optical tweezers for international participants

## Educational Resources

### Laboratory Protocols
- Developed comprehensive protocols for single-molecule experiments
- Created visual guides for complex experimental setups

### Online Materials
- Contributed to open educational resources on biophysical techniques
- Recorded tutorial videos on data analysis for single-molecule experiments

## Outreach

- Participated in science communication events for high school students
- Volunteer for "Meet a Scientist" program, introducing young students to biophysics research
